    Fry Guy v1.0
    -----------------------------------------------

    Introduction
    ------------------------------------------------
    There's an artist who just throws everything around. 
    But he has to leave to go pick up some item. When he 
    leaves, his latest creation Fry comes alive and is 
    pretty mad that there's crap lying everywhere. So Fry 
    decides to go and blow 'em up with his mini paint ball gun.
    Thus, the goal of the game is to destroy all the enemies on the
    map.
